## Description:
This repository contains the scripts for statistical analyses associated with [Rodrigues et al. 2021 published in *Frontiers in Public Health*](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.672473/full). These data were collected as part of the Enteric Research Investigational Network Cooperative Research Center (ERIN) study funded by NIH (NIAID: U18AI090872 to Manning Lab) in collaboration with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and four metropolitan hospitals in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor, and Lansing Michigan. Epidemiologic data was extracted via the Michigan Disease Surveillance System.

Antimicrobial resistance frequencies in Michigan were also compared to publically available data via the [National Antimicrobial Monitoring System (NARMS)](https://www.cdc.gov/narms/index.html).
